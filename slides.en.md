You can write Lambda in any language now.

[The example script](https://gist.github.com/kt3k/17e29c36bd8743289afdf21049906ff4) is very technical as bash script

Who've ever parsed http headers in bash?

It roughly does:
- Initializes the lambda function
- GET request from `/runtime/invocation/next`
- POST back response to `/runtime/invocation/:request_id/response`

Try it in Deno
---
```code
export DENO_DIR=/tmp/deno_dir
echo "
import { $HANDLER_NAME } from '$LAMBDA_TASK_ROOT/$HANDLER_FILE.ts';
const API_ROOT =
  'http://${AWS_LAMBDA_RUNTIME_API}/2018-06-01/runtime/invocation/';
(async () => {
  while (true) {
    const next = await fetch(API_ROOT + 'next');
    const reqId = next.headers.get('Lambda-Runtime-Aws-Request-Id');
    const res = await $HANDLER_NAME(await next.json());
    await (await fetch(
      API_ROOT + reqId + '/response',
      {
        method: 'POST',
        body: JSON.stringify(res)
      }
    )).blob();
  }
})();
" > /tmp/runtime.ts
$SCRIPT_DIR/deno run --allow-net --allow-read /tmp/runtime.ts
```

Major pitfalls:
- Needed to build custom deno
  - to avoid [GLIBC 2.18 problem](https://github.com/denoland/deno/issues/1658)
- Needed to set DENO_DIR to somewhere under /tmp/
  - because Lambda only allows to write under /tmp/

Remaining issues:
- Need to resolve GLIBC 2.18 problem
- Set up CI for Lambda Runtime
  - It seems possible by using AWS SAM
- Support Cloud Function
- Support Azure Function
- Probably we can create Now 2 deno-builder
